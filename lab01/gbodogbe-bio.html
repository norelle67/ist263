        My name is Norelle Gbodogbe! I am an Information Management and Technology major with a concentration in Information Security. I am interested in getting into the cybersecurity field. I have learned how to code in Python and would love to learn more languages. Outside of school, I am a dancer on the OneWorld dance team. I enjoy cooking, laughing with friends, and have an occasional interest in pop culture! I love all things pink despite growing up with all brothers. I have always had a curiosity regarding technology, so it only makes sense that I would seek a degree in IT.
