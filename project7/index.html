    <h2>Website Purpose</h2>

    <p>
      In response to recent state and federal rollbacks of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) policies,
      this website serves as a platform at the intersection of advocacy, empowerment, and technology.
      As a Black woman pursuing a degree in Information Management and Technology with a concentration
      in Information Security, I aim to share my experiences navigating these political changes while
      encouraging others to stand against systemic erasure.
    </p>

    <p>
      This site highlights my leadership and academic experiences, including work with organizations
      such as BLISTS, and promotes resources for students who have been disadvantaged by anti-DEI
      policies. My goal is to create a digitally accessible, politically aware space that supports equity
      and inclusion in the technology field.
