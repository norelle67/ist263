        <h1> Norelle Gbodogbe's Biography</h1>
        <p>My name is Norelle Gbodogbe! I am an Information Management and Technology major with a concentration in Information Security. I am interested in getting into the cybersecurity field. I have learned how to code in Python and would love to learn more languages.</p>
        </p> Outside of school, I am a dancer on the OneWorld dance team. I enjoy cooking, laughing with friends, and have an occasional interest in pop culture! I love all things<strong> pink</strong>strong despite growing up with all brothers. 
        <p>

        <strong>I have always had a curiosity regarding technology, so it only makes sense that I would seek a degree in IT.</strong></p>
