  <h1>Norelle Gbodogbe's Biography</h1>

  <p>My name is Norelle Gbodogbe! I am an Information Management and Technology major with a concentration in Information Security. I am interested in technology. Outside of school, I am a dancer on the OneWorld dance team. I enjoy cooking, laughing with friends, and have an occasional interest in gaming.</p>

  <p>I have always had a curiosity regarding technology, so it only makes sense that I would seek a degree in IT.</p>

  <h2>Personal Information</h2>
  <p>I am such a people's person so outside of going to classes, I enjoy interacting with people in the Schine Student Center.</p>

  <p>My favorite places to study on campus ranked and why</p>
  <dl>
    <dt>Bird Library</dt>
    <dd>I like to study on the third floor because it is quiet and I tend to get the most work done there.</dd>

    <dt>Third floor on Schine</dt>
    <dd>It is very comfy up there and more quiet compared to the other floors. It is also accessible to grab food.</dd>

    <dt>Carnegie Library</dt>
    <dd>It is VERY quiet there but sometimes it can be too much silence.</dd>
